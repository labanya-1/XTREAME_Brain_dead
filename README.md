# XTREAME_Brain_dead
This repo features two ML &amp; NLP projects: IPL Match Winner Prediction (predicts IPL 2025 outcomes using ML) and Research Article Summarization (uses LLMs like BERT, T5  for summarization). Built with Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.


IPL Match Prediction & Research Article Summarization

📌 Overview

This repository contains two exciting ML & NLP projects:

IPL Match Winner Prediction – Predicts IPL 2025 match outcomes using historical data and machine learning models.

Research Article Summarization – Summarizes scientific papers using LLMs (BERT, T5, GPT-4) for extractive and abstractive summarization.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn (ML models)

TensorFlow (Deep learning)

Hugging Face Transformers (LLMs for NLP)
